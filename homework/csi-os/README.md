::::README for CSI- OS::::
==========================

For every part of the assignment, the related images are put into a folder named after the task name. For example, "Kernel file" has the Kernel images for each of the operating systems. 
Also, the images are named after the system they were taken from.

- Windows: 
    - NOTE: Due to your apporval when Carlos asked you, the "windows-kernel.jpg" and "windows-pre-os-process.jpg" came from Geoffory.
    
    - All my imagefiles display the command and results needed

- Mac:
    - All my image files display the command and results needed

> JD: Your Mac shots are generally OK except for the kernel.  You list a bunch of kernel *modules*, which do extend the functionality of the kernel, but they are not the kernel itself.  Also, you display some networking information, but you used `netstat`, which is different from the `ip` information that your Windows shot displayed.  There is a more direct equivalent to `ip` available.

- Linux:
    - All my files display the command and results needed

> JD: Your Linux shots are generally in the right direction except for the kernel.  You point out a bunch of configuration settings, but not the actual code that acts on those settings.  Your networking screenshot also uses `netstat` here, but there is a closer equivalent to `ip` in Windows.
