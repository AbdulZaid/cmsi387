#All of Time and Space

Continue our journey through seminal operating systems literature by using library resources (digital or otherwise) to find at least three additional publications (also digital or otherwise) that are related to and/or build upon the work given out in class. For each found publication:

• State its connection to the other work in our 
  small collection—the connection must be explicit  
  (i.e., cited and overtly discussed in the text). 
  Connections may be to the other work that you 
  find, but at least one must point to something 
  given out in class.
  
• State what it does new or differently from the 
  prior cited works.
  
• Give a brief assessment of the quality of the 
  work. Consider the authors, the publication 
  venue, the level of detail, references cited, etc.

####The First Article: "A new solution to the critical section problem" by Howard P. Katseff*

This article by Howard P. Katseff is directly related to our subject of Process Synchronization, and mainly on Critical Section Structure.  It is related because it's based on exapnding the solutions of Djiksta's, Knuth's, and Eisenberg and McGuire's solution. Moreover, as stated in the introduction "The solution presented here improves on previous solutions by allowing processes to enter their critical sections on a first-come first-served basis."
